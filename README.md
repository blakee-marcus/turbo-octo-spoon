What AniBite is About:

AniBite is a website that gives the targeted adult age group of 20 to 35, the joy of getting options for a recipe of a homemade meal and an anime to pair together. This app does the thinking for you as it randomizes each meal and anime at the same time! Therefore, if the user can not decide which anime to watch or what to make to eat, then that user needs to look no further as AniBite is only a click away. The application is meant to begin to create a winding down experience and a sense of enjoyment for the user.
